# Definition
A Taylor series is an [[Infinite Series|infinite series]], which [[Approximation|approximates]] a [[Function|function]] using a [[Polynomial|polynomial]]. Not only is the Taylor series an [[Approximation|approximation]] of a [[Function|function]], it [[Equality|equals]] it in the [[Limit|limit]].

The [[Polynomial|polynomial]] $p(x)$ is a Taylor series of [[Degree|degree]] $degree(p(x)) = n$ for the [[Function|function]] $f(x)$ iff: $$\forall{n_0} \le n, n \in \mathbb{N}: p^{n_0}(a) = f^{n_0}(a)$$
