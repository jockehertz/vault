# Definition
When [[Light|light]] falls upon a metal surface, [[Electron|electrons]] are emitted. Increasing [[Light#Intensity|intensity]] does not lead to more [[Electron|electrons]] being emitted, [[Frequency|frequency]] does however. This implies that [[Frequency|frequency]] is correlated to [[Energy|energy]]. This certain frequency is known as the *threshold frequency*.


# Einstein's Photoelectric Equation

$$hf=E_0+E_{K_{max}}$$
Where $h$ is [[Planck's Constant]], and $f$ is [[Frequency|frequency]].
