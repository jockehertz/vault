# Definition
The *limit* is something which defines a value as approaching another, getting infinitely closer, but never *actually* equalling it. The [[Syntax|syntax]] looks as follows:
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0}(f(x))$$
This equals $f(0)$, but if $f(0)$ is [[Undefined|undefined]], we can use the limit to get what value it approaces.
